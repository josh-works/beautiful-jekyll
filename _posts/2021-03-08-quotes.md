Well, this brings this mini-blog to a close. We’re close to 15,000 words in this page, and it’s been a worthwhile endeavor for me. I’ve enjoyed more than anything your comments and texts and calls because they’ve led to great discussions about power, cities, politics, and government.

This will go down as one of the best books I’ve ever read. The writing is inspired and the research is well-past thorough. It’s a brilliant book with applications in so many disciplines. I’m prepared to now become one of the acolytes who recommends this book to everyone.
